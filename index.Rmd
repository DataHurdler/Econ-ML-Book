# Preface {-}

The primary purpose of this book, which I started to write in May 2023, is to review, summarize, and organize what I have learned in Machine Learning as a PhD economist. I have taken several Machine Learning related courses on Coursera and Udemy. In 2022, I also worked, briefly, as a data scientist in an AdTech start-up.

In my mind, I pretend that this book is written for those who have some quantitative training but is interested in what Machine Learning can offer, particularly graduate students who have taken at least one econometrics course. My emphases are those algorithms that can provide an alternative, sometimes more useful and rigorous, approach to known problems in economics, business, and social sciences. I also provide Python scripts that I have written to implement these algorithms.

Please email me if you see any errors.
